Because this series is part 2 of a longer workshop, the first lab "Deploying and running Azure Containers" is titled "Lab 5" to maintain the sequence of the complete workshop. 
Labs 1 - 4 can be found in the repo for the first part of the workshop https://github.com/MSUSDEV/Migrating-web-apps-to-Azure/tree/master/Labs
You can find the source files for the sample app at https://github.com/MSUSDEV/SimplDev
To avoid the SQL dependencies from the first part of the workshop you can get the SimplCommerce Docker container that uses a buil-in non-SQL database here https://hub.docker.com/r/simplcommerce/ci-build
